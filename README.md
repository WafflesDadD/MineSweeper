You'll need python added to path and pygame (pip install pygame generally works)

make sure when you execute the code you are in the directory with the assets.

executing should look like this C:\Users\...\MineSweeper> C:/Users/.../AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python.exe "c:/Users/.../MineSweeper/minesweeper.py"
